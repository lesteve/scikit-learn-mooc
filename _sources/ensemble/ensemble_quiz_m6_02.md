```{admonition} Question
In a
[`BaggingClassifier`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.BaggingClassifier.html)

the parameter `base_estimator` is:

- a) any predictor
- b) a decision tree predictor
- c) a linear model predictor

```{admonition} Question

In the context of a classification problem, what are the differences between a
bagging classifier and a random forest classifier:

- a) in a random forest, the base model is always a decision tree
- b) in a random forest, the split threshold values are decided completely at
  random
- c) in a random forest, a random resampling is performed both over features
  as well as over samples
```
